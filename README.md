# FavRestaurants
Input Your Favorite Restaurants And Menu Items


Project Blog

Coming from Ruby and Rails language classes seemed more natural to me.  I wasn't 100% sure about
designing my project by using classes however, I knew that having the separation of concerns was very
important.  Just like my everyday life, if things are not organized or structured, I do not accomplish
too much.  My brain really enjoys running off on it's own and getting distracted.  Using classes in
Fav Restaurants helped me understand that things had a place and if concepts or functions became muddled
together they would no long work correctly.  

Once FavRestaurants was set up I designed in as if each class was it's own js file for an object.  This is 
a very loose explanation of the class concept but it helped me get through.  Classes are 
just syntactic sugar for the prototype based programming of javascript and using the constructor function makes
things much easier when creating objects.  Once the class is created, methods can be created which are defined
on the classes prototype.  You can also create static methods, which are called on the without created an 
instance of the class but on the class itself.  Designing by using the prototype property is my next learning
task, to have a better understanding of exactly what is happening when prototype is used.  I have a lot more 
to learn about javascript but my understanding of instances and objects has grown even after making it through 
the ruby and rails sections.
